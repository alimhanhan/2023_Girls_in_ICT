<br><br><h2>🌱About Our Idea!🌱</h2>
<h3>🚨A Disaster Detection & Response Support System: The combination of Embedded Boards and SW</h3>

<h3>🚨Background of Development</h3>

: Announced by UNDRR the number of disasters on Earth  is increasing  as the climate crisis becomes serious.<br>
👉 As the Earth's climate deteriorates, the frequency of disasters increases, and accordingly, our team AdEco designed a **Disaster Detecton and Resonse System**<br><br>

<h3>🚨Expectation Effectiveness</h3>

: According to data from the `SENDAI FRAMEWORK`, 14 out of 195 countries have multiple risk early warning systems, and only `0.46%` of the world has `predictive systems`.<br>
👉 So by deploying this system in each country, we can make a world that's `predicted by disasters`.

<h3>🚨Disaster Lists to be Detected & Sensors to be used </h3>

: The disasters that can be detected by the program include fire, flood, earthquake, and typhoon. Different sensors are used for detecting each disaster, and the list is as follows.<br><br>
• `Fire` ➡️ Flame detection sensor & Temperature sensor<br>
• `Flood` ➡️ Humidity detection sensor<br>
• `Earthquake` ➡️ Acceleration sensor & Gyro sensor<br>
• `Typhoon` ➡️ Wind speed detection sesor<br><br>

<h3>🚨Flow Charts & Disaster Detection Algorithms</h3>

: Each disaster has its own detection algorithm, and the details are as follows. There are also differences in the measured factors for each algorithm, and the details are as follows.<br><br>
• `Fire detection` ➡️ Presence of flames and temperature measurement<br>
• `Earthquake detection` ➡️ Angle and acceleration measurement<br>
• `Flood detection` ➡️ Humidity measurement<br>
• `Typhoon detection` ➡️ Wind speed measurement

<h3>🚨Monitoring pages for Administrators & Disaster Alert for Users</h3>

: In the event of a disaster, each embedded sensor detects it and sends a notification to the connected user's mobile phone.<br><br>

<h3>🚨Emergency call with GPS</h3>

: When user click the Emergency call button, it connects to the camera and allows users to report disaster immediately, and location is also linked through GPS to enhance reporting effieiency.
